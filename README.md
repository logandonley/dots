# dots

My dotfile and system bootstrapping tool.

## Configuration

Modify `bootstrap.yaml` to suit your needs. This contains the packages, fonts, language runtimes, and more to setup and install.

Add your desired dotfiles into the `./home` directory in the same structure as you want in your `$HOME` directory.

## Running it

```shell
# This runs the entire end-to-end setup
./bootstrap.py
```

```shell
# If you just want to update the dotfiles run
./dots.py
```
